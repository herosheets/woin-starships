<h2>Starship Hull Configuration</h2>
<p class="explainer">
    Select an (optional) hull configuration. There are as many different vessel types as there are stars in the
    sky. The following list is a summary of some common classifications listed in approximate typical size order. Each
    configuration grants the ship one exploit.

<h2>Starship Hull Class</h2>
<p class="explainer">

    Starships are categorized by class, which is a rough measure of tonnage. This initial decision determines the size
    parameters of your ship design. It also determines your crew requirement, fuel capacity, cargo space, and DEFENSE
    values.
