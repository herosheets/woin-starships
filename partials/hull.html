<h2>Starship Hull Configuration</h2>
<p class="explainer">
    Select an (optional) hull configuration. There are as many different vessel types as there are stars in the
    sky. The following list is a summary of some common classifications listed in approximate typical size order. Each
    configuration grants the ship one exploit. The system does not apply the exploit. For some examples of the sizes and types of some famous starships, <a

<h2>Starship Hull Class</h2>
<p class="explainer">

    Starships are categorized by class, which is a rough measure of tonnage. This initial decision determines the size
    parameters of your ship design. It also determines your crew requirement, fuel capacity, cargo space, and DEFENSE
    values.  For especially large ships (those over Class XX or so), space starts to matter less and less.  However, in most objects, mass increases at the cube rate of volume.<br><br>
    While a DEFENSE value cannot drop below 0 during play, larger ships do have negative values which can still counteract bonuses and the like.
