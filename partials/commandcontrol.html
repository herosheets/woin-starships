<h2>Control Computers + Power Plants</h2>
<p class="explainer">

    Vessels require a <b>control computer</b> and a <b>power
plant</b>. Both grant CPU. CPU is a resource budget which determine the vessel's capacity to handle components. While named CPU by default, this resource can be freely renamed to any other core capacity resource. Examples include Power, or even Psionic Energy or Magic, depending on the campaign setting. This Builder allows the total resource budget to be built from any combination of computers and power plants, but setting-specific factors may restrict this.<br>
<br>
Nearly every function on a vessel interacts in some way with the
computer. The computers, sensors, and engineering facilities on a
starship make a up a large part of its efficiency and effectiveness.
&nbsp;A ship's computer system is able to perform faster-than-light
calculations for FTL travel, and ties directly into the sensor array.
Data storage in a ship's computer is so efficient that the concept of
storage capacity does not factor into computer design any more. Some
computer systems have a basic AI, while others do not.<br>

Items marked with an asterisk (*) are AL 10 items; they are only
available in AL 10 settings. These items can drastically change the
nature of a setting, especially in terms of FTL speeds.<br>
<br>
There are different approaches to computer integration and design; the starship designer should choose one. Navigation computers (navcomps or astrogation units)
are an AL 10 technology which allow for vastly higher FTL speeds, but do not take on the processing roles that other computer systems do. Navcomps also
maintain detailed navigational charts of the fastest travel routes,
which are not necessarily in straight
lines when dealing with hyperspace, intense gravity wells, dark energy
fluctuations, and non-euclidian
geometry. The introduction of navcomps makes galaxy-wide travel a
trivial issue.
